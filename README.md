Fine-tuning Model

We provided a pyuthon code for the fine-tuning process (HausaSentiLex_fine_tuning.ipynb) and the training dataset file (HausaSentiLexTrainDataset.txt). This will provide access to users to modify and build same model or train the model with thier dataset for any language.


Testing out model with large data

We provided an open source code in python (HausaSentiLex_bulk.ipynb) for the model to be use in annotating large tweets or any comments.
